# understanding OOP in Java

Parts 1&2 inspired by Tim Buchalka tutorial on Java

###Part 1

//         create a new class for a bank account
//         create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number
//         create all getters and setters
//         create two additional methods
//         1. to allow the customer to deposit funds(increment the balance)
//         2. to allow the customer to withdraw funds, but not become overdrawn (balance < 0)

### Part 2

//        create a new class VipCustomer
//        it should have 3 fields; name, creditLimit and email
//        the 1st constructor is empty and calls the constructor with 3 parameters
//        the 2nd passes on 2 values and defaults a 3rd
//        the 3rd should save all fields
//        create getters

### Part 3

//        Refactor your code so that VipAccount extends BankAccount
//        Override the withdraw method so that the credit line is available
//        Refactor the constructors
